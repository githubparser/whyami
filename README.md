whyami
===

The ontological counterpart to `whoami` - for all your existential command line needs.

Build and Install
-----------------

    $ git clone https://github.com/jkingsman/whyami.git
    $ cd whyami
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

The default install PREFIX is `/usr/bin`.

Usage
-----

`whyami [--belief]` returns a meaning from a random philosophy of belief, or the meaning as optionally specified by some named `belief` system.

Disclaimer
-----
I mean no offense by any meanings. If you see one you disagree with, make a PR. This project is very tongue-in-cheek and should not be taken seriously by anyone, nor do any of the meanings necessarily reflect the author's point of view.
